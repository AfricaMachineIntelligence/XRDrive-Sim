Hand Gesture and skeleton input to enrich the user interface of the games 

This project provides Python code to demonstrate Hand Gestures via on PC camera or depth data, namely Intel® RealSense™ depth cameras. Additionally, this project showcases the utility of convolutional neural networks as a key component of real-time hand tracking pipelines using Intel OpenVINO. Two demo apps are provided showing hand gesture control from an webcam depth camera. A YouTube video demonstrating some functionality the XRDrive code can be found:
